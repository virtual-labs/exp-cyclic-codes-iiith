### Aim 
In this experiment, we will introduce students with the basics of cyclic codes, which form a subclass of linear block codes.
We will first provide a definition of cyclic codes and then describe the generator polynomial associated with a cyclic code. 
While cyclic codes (being linear block codes) can be encoded and decoded using the methods described in Experiments 2 and 4, owing to inherent structural properties, this can be implemented very efficiently using shift registers. 
In this experiment, students will learn efficient shift register based implementation of an encoder and Meggitt decoder for cyclic codes.


The structure of the experiment is as follows:

- Encoding
- Shift register encoding
- Meggitt decoder
